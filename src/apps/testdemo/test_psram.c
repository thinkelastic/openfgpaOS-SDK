/* PSRAM / SRAM memory map.
 *
 * CRAM0 is strictly i_axi-only on the data plane (see
 * GenOpenFpgaVexii.scala — CRAM0 is excluded from the d_axi PMA so
 * the D$ can never reach it; that's the prerequisite for sync-burst
 * CRAM0 refills to not corrupt under multi-master contention).
 * Apps that need to touch CRAM0 as data MUST use the uncached alias
 * 0x38xxxxxx, which routes through p_axi (uncached IO bus).  A
 * cached 0x30xxxxxx store will trap with "store access fault".
 *
 *   CRAM0 cached:    0x30000000 – 0x30FFFFFF (16 MB) — I-fetch only
 *   CRAM0 uncached:  0x38000000 – 0x38FFFFFF (16 MB) — d/IO access
 *   CRAM1 uncached:  0x39000000 – 0x39FFFFFF (16 MB, bridge-accessible)
 *   SRAM:            0x3A000000 – 0x3A03FFFF (256 KB)
 *
 * CRAM1 is FULLY partitioned by the OS:
 *   0x000000 – 0x27FFFF  saves (10 slots × 256 KB) — bridge-persisted
 *   0x280000 – 0x28FFFF  FTAB (filename table) — bridge-written
 *   0x290000 – 0x2FFFFF  file-IO scratch (~448 KB)
 *   0x300000 – 0x3FFFFF  I/O cache
 *   0x400000 – 0xEFFFFF  audio samples (11 MB)
 *   0xF00000 – 0xFFFFFF  AUDIO_SCRATCH_CRAM1 (1 MB) — mixer scratch
 *
 * Picking ANY region the bridge / mixer / file layer touches is
 * non-idempotent across iterations: the original test wrote slot 0
 * (saves) which the bridge then re-read on the next pass; the unused
 * tail turned out to be the audio scratch buffer.
 *
 * file-IO scratch is the only region that is (a) not bridge-managed
 * and (b) only touched during user-initiated file ops. test_psram_memory
 * runs BEFORE any file test, so its readback can't race the OS — and
 * between iterations the test's own pattern is the last write to land. */
