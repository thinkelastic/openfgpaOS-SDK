 * test_midi.c — of_midi engine tests (MD.xx)

 * Tests the MIDI playback engine using synthetic MIDI files built

 * (of_smp_voice) driven by an .ofsf bank (of_smp_bank).  Covers:
 *   - init / play / stop / pump
 *   - pause / resume / playing / paused queries
 *   - set_volume / get_volume
 *   - format 0 single track
 *   - format 1 multi-track
 *   - program change events
 *   - note on / note off
 *   - tempo changes
 *   - end-of-track + loop
