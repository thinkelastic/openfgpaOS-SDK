# path: intermediate objects under .obj/sdk/<name>/, final ELF picked
# up by src/apps/Makefile's release step and dropped into build/sdk/.
#
# For the custom-core path (a standalone openFPGA core wrapping a
# single app under src/<name>/) see scripts/customize.sh and the
# Makefile that script generates.
