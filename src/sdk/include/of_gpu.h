     *
     * Cost: every uint32_t store in _gpu_encode_span goes through the
     * SDRAM controller (~10-15 cycles each vs ~1 cycle cached).  For
     * a max batch (1920 words = 7680 B) that's ~25 µs of CPU encoder
     * time vs ~2 µs cached.  The doorbell-DMA path's mandatory

     * to-end timing (~150 µs/batch fixed overhead at this workload),
     * so the uncached encoder cost is in the noise — verified at
     * ~34 fps either way in the bisection runs.
     *
     * gpu_core's m_rd_* AXI master goes only to the SDRAM arbiter
